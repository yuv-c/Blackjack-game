# Blackjack-game
An offline and online version of the blackjack game written in python

Online version is still under development.

To play the game offline download Blackjack_base.py and Blackjack_offline.py, and run the latter.

Testing is done through the Blackjack_tests.py file


******************** ONLINE VERSION ********************

Currently under development and not working. 
in order to make it work, the user input must be accepted on different threads, or with the use of asyncio library.
I am currently working on integrating the online version with asyncio since I believe it is more suited for what is currently
wrriten.
